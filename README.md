#Introduction


This app will look pretty, it will connect to a DB, it'll get some results, and it'll do stuff with those results. Then it also saves data to the DB. Through it all, I have commented to explain what the code does, and how to write it, instead of just giving you massive functions to stare at. I went from nothing even installed, to a DB-driven web app written in a language you fully understand, and the foundation necessary to build additional functionality into your app. I did it in about 60 minutes of installation and coding time. Is that awesome? I submit that it is.
